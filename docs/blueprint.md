## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A8D5E2) evoking calmness and a clear sky.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8FF), a desaturated version of the primary, for a clean, paper-like feel.
- Accent color: Muted coral (#E9967A), analogous to blue, for highlights and important actions.
- Font: 'Literata', a serif font, with a literary and slightly vintage feel, will bring warmth and style to the interface.
- Use hand-drawn style icons for menu items and actions to reinforce the '日系手帳風' (Japanese Planner Style).
- Employ card-based layouts and sticky note-style elements to present order and menu information, mimicking a planner.
- Subtle animations, such as gentle transitions and fades, to create a smooth, tactile user experience reminiscent of flipping through a physical planner.
